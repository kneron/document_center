# Kneron End to End Simulator v0.15.5

This project allows users to perform image inference using Kneron's built in simulator. As of version 0.5.0 the 520 and 720 simulators have been merged into one codebase, and any existing apps will need to be updated to the new structure to work.

## File Structure

<div align="center">

</div>

* bin: all of the outputs that the application will dump
	* csim_dump: model inference results will be dumped here if you used CSIM
	* dongle_dump: model_inference results will be dumped here if you used Dongle
	* dynasty_dump: model inference results will be dumped here if you used Dynasty

    * input_jsons: input jsons MUST be placed in this folder in the application
  * template_app: template with the requirements to run the simulator
    * you can use this as a base guideline to start your application

## Configuring Input

Kneron simulator uses a JSON file to specify parameters used throughout the testing process.
<div align="center">
<img src="../../imgs/python_app/json.png">
<p>Example input JSON configurations (app/fd_external/input_jsons/fd_rgb.json)</p>
</div>
In each JSON, there are three sections (pre, emu, post) to define parameters necessary to complete the testing process. The parameters shown are the minimum required to run the simulator; you may add new parameters to the "pre" or "post" to pass into your preprocess or postprocess functions.

If any of the required keys are missing, the program will end. The required keys will be specified in their respective sections.

Note on the reordering parameter: this can be specified for your convenience in the postprocess function. By default, the inference results for CSIM and Dynasty will be returned in alphabetical order of the output file names. For CSIM, this will be in order of the outputs designated by CSIM: 1, 2, 3,... For Dynasty, this will be in order of the output node names. If you do not specify the ioinfo_file parameter, the reordering parameter for CSIM should be a list of integers, based on the output order designated by CSIM. Otherwise, it should be a list of strings, based on the output node names. The reordering parameter for Dynasty should be a list of strings, based on the output node names.

#### Postprocess Parameters
**Required keys:** post_type

| Name          | Description                                                        | Acceptable Values                         |

| post_bypass   | Specifies whether postprocess should be bypassed, default is false | true, false                               |
| **post_type** | Name of the postprocess function to run, in Python import format   | any postprocess function you wish to call |

## Custom pre/postprocess
Since inference results can vary based on users' tests, we provide support for integrating custom preprocess and postprocess functions. The preprocess and postprocess functions you supply into the ```pre_type``` and ```post_type``` fields must follow the API that we provide.

Both the preprocess and postprocess must take in a TestConfig class as input. For reference, you can find it defined at python_flow/common/config.py. This class is filled with parameters from the supplied input JSONs and other environment variables. To access all of those parameters, you will need to access the "config" attribute, a dictionary. There are four keys to access the dictionary: ```pre```, ```emu```, ```post```, and ```flow```. The first three keys have values that are dictionaries with the same exact values as in the JSON files. The ```flow``` key simply has values parsed from the command line options and other environment variables such as the input image.

The preprocess must take in as input a TestConfig class and a variable that represents anything you may want to pass into your preprocess function. The second variable may be needed, for example, if your preprocess depends on the results of a previous stage in the flow. It must output a tuple consisting of a list of NumPy arrays and a dictionary. The list of NumPy arrays should be in channel last format (1, h, w, c) and have a one-to-one correspondence with each input you have in your model. The dictionary holds any values you wish to communicate from your preprocess to your postprocess.

The postprocess must take in as input a TestConfig class, a dictionary, and a list of NumPy arrays. The TestConfig class is the same class as used in the preprocess. The dictionary is the same as the second output of your preprocess function. The last input is the results of the model inference. There will be one NumPy array per output of your model, and by default, each array will be in channel last format (d1, d2, ..., c). The order of the output nodes will be based on the list you provided in the ```reordering``` field in the input JSON. The output for the postprocess can be anything that is convenient for your needs.

For preprocess/postprocess reference, you may look at ```app/fd_external/preprocess/fd.py``` and ```app/fd_external/postprocess/fd.py```. For a template of the API, you may look at ```app/template_app```.

### Preprocess

#### Python defined

If your preprocess functions are defined in Python, integration is simple.

1. Make sure your Python function takes two parameters as input: a TestConfig class and a prev_output variable.
2. Make sure your return value is a tuple of a list of your preprocessed NumPy arrays in channel last format and a dictionary of values to be passed to the postprocess.
3. Set the value of the ```pre_type``` field in the input JSON to the name of your function, as defined [here](#setting-up-json).

#### C defined

1. Compile the C/C++ functions into a shared library (.so). Be sure to add ```extern "C"``` to any C++ functions you intend to directly call in the Python flow.
2. Copy the library into your application's directory.
3. Import the shared library into whichever module needs it using the standard ctypes module:

    ```python
    MY_LIB = ctypes.CDLL("./my_lib.so")
    ```

4. Define any C/C++ structures that are needed for parameters as classes in Python. These classes must extend ```ctypes.Structure``` and store the structure fields in the ```_fields_``` variable. This is a list of tuples where the first item is the name of the variable, and the second item is the type of that variable. The names and order must be defined exactly as in the C code.
5. Define a wrapper to the C/C++ function you wish to call. You need to specify three items: the function name as defined in the C code, the input argument types, and the result argument types.
6. Create a Python function that takes a TestConfig class and prev_output variable as input that calls your function wrapper. You can get the inputs you need from the TestConfig class and pass it to the wrapper as needed.
7. Make sure your return value is a tuple of a list of your preprocessed NumPy arrays in channel last format and a dictionary of values to be passed to the postprocess. You will need to translate your C preprocessed data into NumPy arrays for the return value.
8. Set the value of the ```pre_type``` field in the input JSON to the name of your function, as defined [here](#setting-up-json).

#### C defined (using Python API in c_interface/preprocess.py)

1. Add your preprocess function into ```c_interface/520/preprocess/pre_processing_main.c``` or into 720. Make sure it takes in a kdp_image structure (or pointer) as input. Compile the shared library by going into the ```c_interface``` directory and running ```make```.
2. Import the shared library into whichever module needs it using the standard ctypes module:

    ```python
    MY_LIB = ctypes.CDLL("c_structure/libprocessing520.so")
    ```

  The path will need to be modified if you are using a relative path. You may use an absolute path as well.
3. Define any extra C/C++ structures that are needed for parameters as classes in Python. These classes must extend ```ctypes.Structure``` and store the structure fields in the ```_fields_``` variable. This is a list of tuples where the first item is the name of the variable, and the second item is the type of that variable. The names and order must be defined exactly as in the C code.
4. Define a wrapper to the C/C++ function you wish to call. You need to specify three items: the function name as defined in the C code, the input argument types, and the result argument types.
5. Create a Python function that takes a TestConfig class and prev_output variable as input that calls your function wrapper. You can get the inputs you need from the TestConfig class and pass it to the wrapper as needed.
6. Call either ```load_image_to_memory``` or ```load_binary_to_memory```, depending on the type of your input image, to load the file into the kdp_image structure.
7. Call your Python C function wrapper.
8. Call ```get_rgb_data``` to get the preprocessed C data into a NumPy array in channel last format.
9. Make sure your return value is the NumPy array from ```get_rgb_data``` and a dictionary of values to be passed to the postprocess.
10. Set the value of the ```pre_type``` field in the input JSON to the name of your function, as defined [here](#setting-up-json).

Note: examples on the structure wrappers can be found under ```c_structure``` in the kdp_image files; examples on the function wrappers can be found under ```c_structure``` in postprocess.py and preprocess.py.

### Postprocess

#### Python defined

If your postprocess functions are defined in Python, integration is simple yet again.

1. Make sure your Python function takes three parameters as input: a TestConfig class, a dictionary, and a list of NumPy arrays.
2. Make sure your return value is whatever is convenient for your usage.
3. Set the value of the ```post_type``` field in the input JSON to the name of your function, as defined [here](setting-up-json).

#### C defined

1. Like the preprocess, compile the C/C++ functions into a shared library (.so).
2. However, your postprocess C function should take in an kdp_image structure as input, as the helper functions will load data into this class. Depending on the version, the Python class is defined in ```c_structure/kdp_image_520.py``` or ```c_structure/kdp_image_720.py```, and the C structure is defined in ```c_structure/520/include/kdpio.h``` or ```c_structure/720/postprocess/kneron_api_data.h```. Your postprocess function MUST include the header containing the kdp_image structure for the corresponding version that you wish to run.
3. Copy the library into your application's directory.
4. Import the shared library into whichever module needs it using the standard ctypes module.
5. Define any C/C++ structures and function wrappers that are needed as in the preprocess.
6. Create a Python function that takes a TestConfig class and prev_output variable as input that calls your function wrapper. You must load the output data into memory before calling your function wrapper. To do so, call ```run_c_function``` with the appropriate arguments. Example usage can be found in ```app/fdr_external/postprocess/fd.py``` under the postprocess function. Do note that these functions currently only work with CSIM, since the setup.bin file is required as input.
7. Make sure your return value is whatever is convenient for your usage. You may also use ```get_result``` to help get the Python data structure back if your result is stored in a structure inside kdp_image.
8. Set the value of the ```post_type``` field in the input JSON to the name of your function, as defined [here](#setting-up-json).

There are also some conversion functions for your convenience under ```python_flow/utils/utils.py```.
Use ```convert_binary_to_numpy``` to get a NumPy array from an input binary image. Use ```convert_pre_numpy_to_rgba``` to dump a NumPy array into RGBA binary used for CSIM.

## Adding own application

We will go over how to create your own application for testing. It is recommended to copy ```app/template_app``` as a base; we will refer to this application as ```my_app```. All your application code should be placed under ```app/my_app/```.

You will need the following to run your application:

* all model files that you plan on testing
	* BIE if you are running Dynasty fixed, ONNX if you are running Dynasty float
	* weight, setup, and command binaries if you are running CSIM 520/720, ioinfo CSV file is optional
* preprocess and postprocess functions
* input JSON files for each of your models
* flow.py to control the simulator flow
* a set of test images

### Model files

To get the input model files from your model, [follow the steps in section 2](http://doc.kneron.com/docs/#toolchain/command_line/). The ONNX, BIE, ioinfo CSV, and weight/setup/command binaries will all be generated upon completing step 2.3.

### Preprocess and postprocess

[Follow these steps](#custom-prepostprocess) to add your preprocess and postprocess functions. You may use ```my_app/template_app/preprocess.py``` and ```my_app/template_app/postprocess.py``` as a guideline.

### Setting up JSON

We will be using ```my_app/postprocess.py```, ```my_app/preprocess.py```, and ```my_app/input_jsons/example.json``` for this section. Reminder that all input JSON files MUST be placed under ```my_app/input_jsons```. Refer to these [tables](#configuring-input) for more information about each specific parameter.

1. Fill in the ```pre_type``` and ```post_type``` fields with the corresponding functions you would like to run for preprocess and postprocess. In our case, it will be the ```preprocess``` and ```postprocess``` functions in their respective files. You want to fill in these two fields with a string that is similar to a Python import, with the import being relative to ```my_app/```. For the ```pre_type``` field, it would be ```preprocess.preprocess```. It is essentially the relative path to the preprocess file with "." instead of "/", and with the name of your preprocess function attached to the end. It is the same case for the postprocess function.
2. Fill in the type of inferencer and Kneron platform you wish to use in ```emu_mode``` and ```platform```.
3. Fill in ```model_type``` with the name of your model (this is only for dumping out files).
4. Fill in the subsection that you set in ```emu_mode``` with the correct values. The paths you specify may be absolute or relative to ```my_app/```.
5. Fill in or modify any other sections in the input JSON that you feel is appropriate.

### Setting up flow

We will be referring to ```my_app/flow.py``` for this section. DO NOT place ```flow.py``` in another folder; it must be placed in the base folder of the application.

<div align="center">
<img src="../../imgs/python_app/example_flow.png">
<p>Example flow.py</p>
</div>

1. Import ```python_flow/flow.py```.
2. Fill in the user_config dictionary with all of the input JSON files to be used. The key should be the model name, and the value should be the path to the input JSON, relative to ```my_app/```. The model name here does not need to match the ```model_type``` in the input JSON; it will just be for access in your test function. DO NOT change the name of ```user_config```.
3. Define a test function that takes in as input a list of string image files and a dictionary of models mapped to a TestConfig. (```your_test_name``` in this example). The list of string image files will be of length one unless you choose the ```fusion``` command line option; normally you would either select bin or image (fusion is a special case).
	1. Call ```flow.run_simulator``` once for each stage in your flow. The inputs are a TestConfig class, the list of input image files, and any data you wish to pass into your preprocess function. The TestConfig class comes from accessing the user_config dictionary with the model JSON you wish to use. The preprocess input may be set to None if you do not need it.
	2. Add any extra work you may need for your testing.
4. You may return a dictionary to be dumped out to a file. The dictionary will be dumped to an output JSON file in a file called ```results.json``` with the same keys and values that you provide. There will be one JSON file per input image that you provide; it will be under the bin folder following the same path as the original image. This is for convenience to see all the results for each test image that you provide.

### Running the test.

The last step is to prepare your image dataset. Your image data set can be placed anywhere. An small example dataset is in ```app/test_image_folder```.

Now, we can run the test. Arguments are explained [here](#usage). This is assuming you copied ```my_app``` into the app folder.

```bash
python3 simulator.py app/my_app your_test_image_folder your_test_name
```

Use this command to run the fdr example set up in ```app/fd_external```:

```bash
python3 simulator.py app/fd_external app/test_image_folder/fd fdr
```

## Python API Inference

This is a standalone feature that allows the user to perform inference given a model and some inputs. This is separate from the E2E Simulator itself. For details, you can take a look at ```python_flow/kneron_inference.py```.

### Necessary items

There are only two items that you need to prepare to run the inference function. Everything else is optional.

* preprocessed input: list of NumPy arrays in (1, h, w, c) format
* model file: depending on what kind of model you want to run, but it will be one of NEF, ONNX, and BIE file

### Inputs

```python
def kneron_inference(pre_results, nef_file="", onnx_file="", bie_file="", model_id=None,
                     input_names=[], radix=8, data_type="float", reordering=[],
                     ioinfo_file="", dump=False, platform=520)
```

* ```pre_results```: same as ```preprocessed input``` mentioned above
* ```nef_file/onnx_file/bie_file```: path to your input model file
	* only one of these will be used, if they are all specified priority is NEF -> ONNX -> BIE
* ```model_id```: ID of model to run inference
	* only used with NEF file
  * only needed if NEF model has multiple models
* ```input_names```: list of input node names
	* only needed with ONNX/BIE file
* ```radix```: integer radix to convert from float to fixed input
	* for NEF file, will be used to convert to CSIM RGBA input
	* for ONNX/BIE file, will be used to dump RGBA file for debugging
* ```data_type```: string data format that you would like the output returned as
	* ```float``` or ```fixed```
* ```reordering```: list of node names/integers specifying the output order
	* integers for NEF file without ```ioinfo_file```, node names with ```ioinfo_file```
	* node names for ONNX and BIE file
* ```ioinfo_file```: string path to file mapping output node number to name
	* only used with NEF file
* ```dump```: flag to dump intermediate nodes
* ```platform```: integer platform to be used
	* used with NEF file to prepare CSIM input
	* used with BIE file to indicate Dynasty fixed model version
	* ```520``` or ```720```

### Usage

Prepare a preprocess function and postprocess function. Then, simply call the kneron_inference function using the results of your preprocess function and input model file to get inference results. Then, use those inference results as input into your postprocess function.

### Example

For a detailed example on how to call the kneron_inference function, please explore this [YOLO example](http://doc.kneron.com/docs/toolchain/yolo_example/#python-api).

## FAQ

### 1. How do I enable simulator output?

When printing info in Python, by default, the simulator will suppress the output. To enable this printing, use the ```-d``` option on the command line.

### 2. How can I display bounding box results on my image?

There is a display function in ```python_flow/utils/utils.py``` that can be called. When using this function, the list of bounding boxes input will need to follow a specific format. Each box in the list must have the following values to display the correct box on the image: (x, y, w, h, score, class).

### 3. How do I convert the CSIM fixed point inference results into floating point results?

The inference output when using CSIM 520/720 are fixed point values in a text file. By default, the simulator will convert those fixed point values into floating point NumPy arrays. You can set the ```data_type``` field in the input_json to get the inference results as fixed point values. The conversion from fixed to floating point values is as follows:

```python
float_val = fixed_val / scale / (2 ^ radix)
```

Through CSIM, every output node has a corresponding scale and radix value. For 520, this is stored in a file called ```radix_scale_info.txt``` in the same directory as the output values. For 720, this is stored in a file called ```dma2seq.info``` per output node in the same directory as the output values.

### 4. What are the memory layouts for the inference results of CSIM 520 and 720?

The memory layout for the output node data after CSIM inference is different between 520 and 720. For 520, the data values are in (h, c, w_align) format, where w_align is the width aligned to the nearest 16 bytes. For 720, the data values are in (c, h, w_align) format, where w_align is the width aligned to the nearest 16 bytes.

Let's look at an example where c = 4, h = 12, and w = 12. Indexing starts at 0 for this example.

<div align="center">
<img src="../../imgs/python_app/memory_layouts.png">
<p>Memory layouts</p>
</div>

For both 520 and 720, we can see that the first 12 bytes of data correspond to the width dimension. The next 4 bytes will then be filled with whatever data is in that memory after inference, since the width dimension is aligned to the nearest 16 bytes. The following is where we see the difference in layouts between 520 and 720: for 520, the channel dimension is next, but for 720, the height dimension is next.

For 520, the next 16 bytes of data correspond to channel of 1, while for 720, the next 16 bytes of data correspond to height of 1. Let's take the 20th byte of data as an example. For 520, this would correspond to c = 1, w = 4, and h = 0. However, for 720, this would correspond to c = 0, w = 4, and h = 1.

To recap, for 520, width increments first, up to the aligned 16 byte width. Channel increments next, and height increments last. For 720, width increments first, also up to the aligned 16 byte width. Height increments next, and channel increments last.

## Useful notes/recap/reminder

* When using C postprocess, calling ```run_c_function``` with the appropriate arguments will be everything you need to call your C code. You may also use ```get_result``` to get your class strcture if you're result is in a C structure inside kdp_image.
* C structure wrapper examples can be found under ```python_flow/kdp_image_520.py``` (or 720 version) and ```python_flow/wrappers.py```; C function wrapper examples can be found under ```python_flow/preprocess.py``` or ```python_flow/postprocess.py```.
